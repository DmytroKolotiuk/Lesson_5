			<p>The Palm Fountain
				Experience the wonders of the Palm Fountain at The Pointe in Palm Jumeirah,the largest fountain in Dubai and
				the world!
				Spanning across the boulevard of The Pointe at Palm Jumeirah-Dubai, The Palm Fountain is officially the
				world’s largest fountain.
				The Largest Fountain In Dubai and The World
				The two giant floating platforms cover 14,000 sq meters of sea water, towering at 105 meters, and lighting
				up the sky of Dubai with magical 3,000 LEDs. The fountain also dances to hit songs from all around the
				globe. The Palm Fountain enthralls visitors with spectacular shows daily from sunset to midnight.</p>

			<h1 class="the-palm">The Palm</h1>
			<p>The Palm Jumeirah is an archipelago of artificial islands on the Persian Gulf in Jumeirah, Dubai, United
				Arab Emirates. It is part of a larger series of developments called the Palm Islands, including Palm Jebel
				Ali and Palm Deira, which, if completed, will together increase Dubai's shoreline by a total of 520
				kilometres (320 mi).[1] It has an estimated population of at least 10,000 as of 2017.
				The islands were created using land reclamation. The construction was done as a joint venture by two Dutch
				specialist companies, Van Oord and Boskalis. The same companies also created The World. The recently opened
				destinations The Pointe, Club Vista Mare and Nakheel Mall are the latest additions to Palm Jumeirah.</p>

		<div class="museum">
			<h1 class="future">Museum of Future</h1>
			<p>The  Museum of the Future (Arabic: متحف المستقبل)[  is an exhibition space for innovative and futuristic
				ideologies, services, and products. Located in the Financial District of Dubai, UAE, the Museum of the
				Future has three main elements: green hill, building, and void. Founded by the Dubai Future
				Foundation. It was set to open in 2021, but as of December of that year had yet to fully do so. The
				Government of the United Arab Emirates later opened the museum on 22 February 2022. The choice of the
				date was officially made because the 22nd of February 2022 is a palindrome date.[citation needed]

				The goal of this museum is to promote technological development and innovation, especially in the fields of
				robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

			<p>The Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo was designed by Peddle Thorp and is managed by Emaar Entertainment. The
				aquarium, located in The Dubai Mall, showcases more than 300 species of marine animals, including sharks and
				rays.

				Managed by Emaar Entertainment, it was awarded with the ‘Certificate of Excellence’ and won the ‘Images Most
				Admired Retailer of the Year – Leisure & Entertainment’ at Images RetailME Awards 2012.

		<div class="mall">
			<h1 class="dubai-mall">Dubai Mall</h1>
			<p>The Dubai Mall (Arabic: دبي مول "Dubai Mall") is a shopping mall in Dubai. It is the second largest mall in
				the world after the Iran Mall by total land area, and the 26th-largest shopping mall in the world by
				gross leasable area, tying with West Edmonton Mall and Fashion Island (Bangkok)—both of which are older than
				it. It has a total retail floor area of 502,000 square metres (5,400,000 sq ft). Located in Dubai, United
				Arab Emirates, it is part of the 20-billion-dollar Downtown complex (called Downtown Dubai) adjacent to the
				iconic Burj Khalifa, and includes over 1,200 shops. In 2011, it was the most visited building on
				the planet, attracting over 54 million visitors each year.[
				Twice delayed, Dubai Mall opened on 4 November 2008, with about 1000 retailers, marking the world's second
				largest-ever mall opening in retail history behind West Edmonton Mall. However, it does not have the most
				gross leasable space, and is surpassed in that category by nineteen malls including the New South China
				Mall, which is the world's second-largest, Golden Resources Mall, SM City North Edsa, and SM Mall of Asia.
